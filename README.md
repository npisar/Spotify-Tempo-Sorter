# Spotify-Tempo-Sorter
Simple Python script written using Spotipy to find the bpm of songs based on a search query


# Setup
For the program to work, you'll need 3 values that you should paste into commands.txt

First and foremost, however, you will need to install the Spotipy Python library.
Find instructions for that [here](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.24.0/#installation)

# Obtaining the Client ID and Client Secret
You'll need to create an app on the Spotify developer site for the Client ID and Client Secret. These values are tied to a dev application and are used to make the library actually work.
Go to [the developer site](https://developer.spotify.com/) and log in with your Spotify account.

Once you log in, go to your [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and create an app.

Once you choose a name and description, copy and paste the Client ID and Client Secret into [commands.txt](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
